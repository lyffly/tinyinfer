## Introduction

After months of efforts, we are pleased to announce the evolution from Qwen1.5 to Qwen2. This time, we bring to you:

* Pretrained and instruction-tuned models of 5 sizes, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, and **Qwen2-72B**;
* Having been trained on data in **27** additional languages besides English and Chinese;
* State-of-the-art performance in a large number of benchmark evaluations;
* Significantly improved performance in coding and mathematics;  
* Extended context length support up to **128K** tokens with Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct.


## News
* 2024.06.06: We released the Qwen2 series. Check our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2/)!
* 2024.03.28: We released the first MoE model of Qwen: Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B! Temporarily, only HF transformers and vLLM support the model. We will soon add the support of llama.cpp, mlx-lm, etc. Check our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-moe/) for more information!
* 2024.02.05: We released the Qwen1.5 series.

## Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2/"> üìë blog</a>.


## Requirements
* `transformers>=4.40.0` for Qwen2 dense and MoE models. The latest version is recommended.

> [!Warning]
> <div align="center">
> <b>
> üö® This is a must because `transformers` integrated Qwen2 codes since `4.37.0` and Qwen2Moe code since `4.40.0`.
> </b>
> </div>

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).

## Quickstart

### ü§ó Hugging Face Transformers

Here we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with `transformers`:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct"
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

For quantized models, we advise you to use the GPTQ and AWQ correspondents, namely `Qwen2-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int8`, `Qwen2-7B-Instruct-AWQ`. 

### ü§ñ ModelScope
We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. `snapshot_download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.

### üíª Run locally

#### Ollama

> [!Warning]
> You need `ollama>=0.1.42`.


> [!NOTE]
> <div align="center">
> Ollama provides an <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md">OpenAI-compatible API</a>, which however does NOT support <b>function calling</b>. For tool use capabilities, consider using <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent</a>, which offers a wrapper for function calling over the API.
> </div>

After [installing ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md), you can initiate the ollama service with the following command:
```shell
ollama serve
# You need to keep this service running whenever you are using ollama
```

To pull a model checkpoint and run the model, use the `ollama run` command. You can specify a model size by adding a suffix to `qwen2`, such as `:0.5b`, `:1.5b`, `:7b`, or `:72b`:
```shell
ollama run qwen2:7b
# To exit, type "/bye" and press ENTER
```

You can also access the ollama service via its OpenAI-compatible API. Please note that you need to (1) keep `ollama serve` running while using the API, and (2) execute `ollama run qwen2:7b` before utilizing this API to ensure that the model checkpoint is prepared.
```py
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1/',
    api_key='ollama',  # required but ignored
)
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': 'Say this is a test',
        }
    ],
    model='qwen2:7b',
)
```

For additional details, please visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/).

#### llama.cpp

> [!Warning]
> You need `llama.cpp>=b3370`.

Download our provided GGUF files or create them by yourself, and you can directly use them with the latest [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with a one-line command:
```shell
./llama-cli -m <path-to-file> -n 512 -co -i -if -f prompts/chat-with-qwen.txt --in-prefix "<|im_start|>user\n" --in-suffix "<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
```

#### MLX-LM

If you are running on Apple Silicon, we have also provided checkpoints compatible with [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/blob/main/llms/README.md). Look for models ending with MLX on HuggingFace Hub, like [Qwen2-7B-Instruct-MLX](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct-MLX).

#### LMStudio

Qwen2 has already been supported by [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/). You can directly use LMStudio with our GGUF files.

#### OpenVINO

Qwen2 has already been supported by [OpenVINO toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit). You can install and run this [chatbot example](https://github.com/OpenVINO-dev-contest/Qwen2.openvino) with Intel CPU, integrated GPU or discrete GPU. 


## Web UI

#### Text generation web UI

You can directly use [`text-generation-webui`](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) for creating a web UI demo. If you use GGUF, remember to install the latest wheel of `llama.cpp` with the support of Qwen2.


#### llamafile

Clone [`llamafile`](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), run source install, and then create your own llamafile with the GGUF file following the guide [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-llamafiles). You are able to run one line of command, say `./qwen.llamafile`, to create a demo.


## Deployment

Qwen2 is supported by multiple inference frameworks. Here we demonstrate the usage of `vLLM` and `SGLang`.

> [!Warning]
> <div align="center">
> The OpenAI-compatible APIs provided by vLLM and SGLang currently do NOT support <b>function calling</b>. For tool use capabilities, <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent</a> provides a wrapper around these APIs to support function calling.
> </div>

### vLLM

We advise you to use `vLLM>=0.4.0` to build OpenAI-compatible API service. Start the server with a chat model, e.g. `Qwen2-7B-Instruct`:
```shell
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --served-model-name Qwen2-7B-Instruct --model Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct 
```

Then use the chat API as demonstrated below:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something about large language models."}
    ]
    }'
```
```python
from openai import OpenAI
# Set OpenAI's API key and API base to use vLLM's API server.
openai_api_key = "EMPTY"
openai_api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something about large language models."},
    ]
)
print("Chat response:", chat_response)
```

### SGLang

> [!NOTE]
> <div align="center">
> SGLang now does NOT support the <b>Qwen2MoeForCausalLM</b> architecture, thus making <b>Qwen2-57B-A14B</b> incompatible.
> </div>

Please install `SGLang` from source. Similar to `vLLM`, you need to launch a server and use OpenAI-compatible API service. Start the server first:
```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct --port 30000
```
You can use it in Python as shown below:
```python
from sglang import function, system, user, assistant, gen, set_default_backend, RuntimeEndpoint

@function
def multi_turn_question(s, question_1, question_2):
    s += system("You are a helpful assistant.")
    s += user(question_1)
    s += assistant(gen("answer_1", max_tokens=256))
    s += user(question_2)
    s += assistant(gen("answer_2", max_tokens=256))

set_default_backend(RuntimeEndpoint("http://localhost:30000"))

state = multi_turn_question.run(
    question_1="What is the capital of China?",
    question_2="List two local attractions.",
)

for m in state.messages():
    print(m["role"], ":", m["content"])

print(state["answer_1"])
```

## Finetuning

We advise you to use training frameworks, including [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), [Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), [Swift](https://github.com/modelscope/swift), etc., to finetune your models with SFT, DPO, PPO, etc.

## üê≥ Docker

To simplify the deployment process, we provide docker images with pre-built environments: [qwenllm/qwen](https://hub.docker.com/r/qwenllm/qwen). You only need to install the driver and download model files to launch demos and finetune the model.

```bash
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --network=host --rm --name qwen2 -it qwenllm/qwen:2-cu121 bash
```

## License Agreement

Check the license of each model inside its HF repo. It is NOT necessary for you to submit a request for commercial usage.
